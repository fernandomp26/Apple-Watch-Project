# Apple-Watch-Project
A project developed by me using HTML, CSS and a tool that allows you to make a very interactive and complete page: JavaScript. Before I study about JS and your power, I developed a interactive Apple Watch page. You can change the color, the size and the photos and, with all of that, the informations change too. Hope you like it!
